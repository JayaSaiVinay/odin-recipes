    But then there may be innumerable Biryanis, but “Hyderabadi Dum Biryani” has its own place. Sourness, spice and taste in it are all unique. 
    In fact, Hyderabadi Dum Biryani or Mutton Dum Biryani first and only then Chicken Biryani 
    and Veg Biryanis have found their name.

  <p>
    Though Hyderabadi Biryani has been introduced by the Nizams, Andhras have added their own spices and made it even tastier. Biryani should be cooked on the wood fire, and only then it is authentic say Biryani Masters. 
    But now that we do not use wood fire much, we could still get the same taste cooking on a gas stove.
